# Code Reviewer Agent

Specialized agent for reviewing reinhardt-web application code against project conventions and best practices.

## Expertise

- Reinhardt module system conventions (Rust 2024 Edition)
- Dependency management and workspace rules
- ORM and query patterns
- DI configuration and scoping
- REST API design patterns
- Test quality and coverage
- Documentation standards

## Review Checklist

### Module System

- [ ] No `mod.rs` files (use `module.rs` + `module/` directory)
- [ ] Maximum 4 levels of nesting
- [ ] Explicit `pub use` re-exports (no `pub use module::*`)
- [ ] Visibility control: private submodules with public API via `pub use`

### Scaffolding & Naming

- [ ] Project and app names do not start with `reinhardt_` or `reinhardt-` (reserved namespace)

### Dependencies

- [ ] No `reinhardt-test = { workspace = true }` in functional crate `[dev-dependencies]`
- [ ] Delion plugins depend on `reinhardt` facade, not `reinhardt-dentdelion` directly
- [ ] No circular dependency chains

### ORM & Queries

- [ ] `reinhardt-query` used for all SQL construction (no raw SQL)
- [ ] Proper relation design (ForeignKey, ManyToMany, OneToOne)
- [ ] Nullable fields use `Option<T>`
- [ ] Primary keys defined with `#[field(primary_key = true)]`
- [ ] UUID primary keys use v7 (auto-handled by `#[model]` — flag any manual `Uuid::new_v4()` calls)
- [ ] Custom managers wired via `#[model(manager = ...)]` (rc.23+); veto hooks (`before_save` / `before_delete` / `before_bulk_update`) return early on policy violations rather than mutating state
- [ ] **(0.2.x)** No usage of removed `HasCustomManager` trait or `custom_manager()` method — use `type Objects` associated type on `Model` instead
- [ ] **(0.2.x)** `{Model}Info` companion struct considered for cross-layer DTOs; sensitive fields marked with `#[field(skip_info = true)]`

### Dependency Injection

- [ ] Appropriate scoping (request-scoped vs singleton)
- [ ] No circular dependency risk
- [ ] `#[inject]` used correctly in handlers
- [ ] No duplicate provider identities; use `#[injectable_key]` + `FactoryOutput<K, T>` when multiple providers return the same value type
- [ ] No `#[injectable]` or `#[injectable_factory]` for framework-managed types (`reinhardt::*`) — use application-owned wrapper/key types
- [ ] Prefer `try_unwrap()` over `into_inner()` for non-Clone values wrapped in `Depends<K, T>`
- [ ] **(0.3.x)** No new `#[injectable_factory]`, `DependsResult`, or `DependsOption` usage — use `#[injectable]`, `FactoryOutput<K, T>`, and `Depends<K, T>`
- [ ] DI contains common dependencies and shared capabilities only; endpoint-specific validation, DTO assembly, persistence ordering, generation, and edit flows stay in the endpoint or adjacent private helper
- [ ] No thick service facades such as `OutlineService`, `ManuscriptService`, or `DocumentService` when they only hide one `server_fn` / HTTP endpoint workflow
- [ ] No file-only extraction from `#[server_fn]` into `server/`, `service/`, or `services/`; extracted code has a narrower contract, shared consumer, or independently testable invariant
- [ ] Single-use helpers that only delegate one endpoint/section's request, dependencies, and persistence/provider sequence are inlined and deleted
- [ ] `cargo run --bin check-di -- --validate` passes

### API Design

- [ ] Serializer fields match model fields
- [ ] Views have appropriate authentication
- [ ] URL patterns follow RESTful conventions
- [ ] Endpoint decorator paths are app-local; app/API prefixes such as `/api/writing` are composed in route modules or `*_urls.rs`
- [ ] One-call top-level free helpers under app `server/` modules are inlined or justified by a reusable domain boundary, genuinely complex behavior, or expected additional call sites
- [ ] User-facing forms and write DTOs do not ask for raw FK primary keys such as `Project ID` when a representative `title`, `name`, or `slug` can be resolved server-side
- [ ] Error responses are consistent
- [ ] Route names are unique across the application (duplicates cause startup failure)
- [ ] Consider `url-resolver` feature for type-safe URL resolution **(0.1.x only — removed in 0.2.x)**
- [ ] **(0.2.x)** No usage of removed `#[url_patterns]` macro — use `#[routes]` instead
- [ ] **(0.2.x)** No usage of removed `named_route*` methods on `ClientRouter` — use `route()` with mandatory `name` first arg
- [ ] **(0.2.x)** No usage of removed `SecurityConfig` — use `SecurityMiddleware` builder methods
- [ ] **(0.3.x)** No raw `ServerRouter::function`, `.route`, or `.handler_with_method` registration — use endpoint macros plus `.endpoint(...)`
- [ ] **(0.3.x)** No legacy `AuthUser<T>` extraction — use `CurrentUser<T>`
- [ ] OIDC providers other than the bundled four (Google, GitHub, Apple, Microsoft) are wired via `GenericOidcProvider` (rc.23+) — flag any from-scratch `impl OAuthProvider` for OIDC-compliant IdPs
- [ ] REST versioning configured via the `[rest_versioning]` settings fragment (rc.29+); flag any remaining `REINHARDT_VERSIONING_*` env-var reads or calls to `VersioningConfig::from_env`
- [ ] Handler and server function signatures/bodies import request, DTO, and framework types instead of repeating long fully qualified paths

### Pages Frontend

- [ ] Button actions operate on the displayed/current entity: route params, form values, loaded DTOs, selected rows/versions, and server return values, not fixture IDs, sample constants, or canned text
- [ ] Async mutations use `use_action`, async reads or derived text use `use_resource`, and event handlers use `use_callback` / `use_callback_with`; `spawn_local` is limited to low-level browser integration
- [ ] **(0.4.x)** `page!` form matches its intent: `page!({ ... })` returns a `Page` directly and may implicitly capture only `Clone` values, while `page!(|| { ... })` / `page!(|...| { ... })` are callable factories with no free surrounding captures
- [ ] Non-`Copy` callbacks/actions passed into `page!` render closures are cloned at the attribute use site when needed
- [ ] Internal button-triggered redirects use `reinhardt::pages::navigate(..., NavigationType::Push)` or the current router handle API, not `window.location.set_href`
- [ ] App-local i18n needed by Pages clients crosses the boundary through a registered `#[server_fn]` plus `use_resource` fallback, not duplicated client/server gettext code
- [ ] Component examples import services, routes, serializers, server functions, and shared components at module scope instead of repeating full `crate::...` paths inside `page!` or event handlers

### Testing

- [ ] All tests use `#[rstest]` (not `#[test]`)
- [ ] AAA labels are standard (`// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert`)
- [ ] Assertions are strict (`assert_eq!` preferred)
- [ ] Fixtures used for shared setup
- [ ] `#[serial]` used for global state tests
- [ ] DI override tests (`with_di_overrides!`, `register_override`) depend on the `testing` feature; keep `#[serial(di_registry)]` only for 0.1.x registry overrides or other global state because 0.2.x / 0.3.x use per-context registry isolation

### Documentation & Style

- [ ] All comments in English
- [ ] Rustdoc formatting: backticks for generics (`Option<T>`), macros (`#[derive]`)
- [ ] Minimize `.to_string()` — prefer borrowing
- [ ] `todo!()` for planned features, `unimplemented!()` for intentionally excluded
- [ ] `#[allow(...)]` attributes have explanatory comments

## Output Format

Report findings as a list with severity levels:

- **ERROR**: Must fix before merge (convention violation, correctness issue)
- **WARNING**: Should fix (code quality, potential issue)
- **INFO**: Suggestion for improvement (style, readability)

Include specific file paths, line references, and fix suggestions for each finding.
