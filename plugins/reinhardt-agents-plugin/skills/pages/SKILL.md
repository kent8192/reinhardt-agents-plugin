# Reinhardt Pages (WASM Frontend)

Guide developers through building WASM frontend applications using reinhardt-pages.

## When to Use

- User creates or modifies WASM frontend components
- User works with `page!`, `head!`, `form!` macros or `#[server_fn]`
- User sets up reactive state with Signal, Effect, Memo, or hooks
- User configures client-side routing, SSR, or hydration
- User mentions: "page", "head", "form", "server_fn", "Signal", "useState", "useEffect", "watch", "i18n", "translation", "locale", "t!", "SSR", "hydration", "WASM", "frontend", "router", "ApiQuerySet", "Table", "prelude", "component"

## Workflow

### Creating a New Page

1. **Define Page Component** — read `references/page-macro.md`
2. **Add Head Section** — read `references/head-form-macros.md` (if SSR)
3. **Set Up Reactivity** — read `references/reactive-hooks.md`
4. **Add Pages I18n** — read `references/i18n.md` for localized UI, locale switching, or SSR/hydration translations
5. **Configure Routing** — read `references/routing-ssr.md` (if SPA)
6. **Add Server Functions** — read `references/head-form-macros.md` (`#[server_fn]` section)
7. **Connect API** — read `references/api-tables.md` (if data fetching)
8. **Test** — read `references/testing-guide.md`

### Creating a Form

1. **Define Form** — read `references/head-form-macros.md` (form! section)
2. **Add Server Function** — read `references/head-form-macros.md` (`#[server_fn]` section)
3. **Embed in Page** — read `references/page-macro.md`
4. **Test** — read `references/testing-guide.md`

## Important Rules

- Prefer explicit imports over prelude (e.g., `use reinhardt::pages::component::Page;`) — see reinhardt-cloud dashboard for the canonical import style
- Import app/framework types at the top of the module instead of repeating long fully qualified paths in components or server function signatures/bodies
- In route-backed UI, wire buttons and actions to route params, form values, loaded DTOs, selected rows/versions, and server return values; never leave demo fixture IDs, sample constants, or canned text in production route actions
- Build static form structure with `form!` and dynamic form state with `use_form`
- For user-facing relation inputs, show representative values such as `title`, `name`, or `slug`; do not ask users to type raw foreign-key primary keys unless the surface is internal/admin-only or no useful representative field exists
- Configure `cfg_aliases` in `build.rs` for `wasm`/`native` and `server`/`client` aliases
- Event handlers in `page!` are auto-handled across platforms (no manual `#[cfg(wasm)]` needed)
- Use `watch {}` for reactive conditionals (not static `if` with extracted Signal values)
- Use route reverse helpers for `href`, `action`, and `formaction` when named routes exist; avoid hardcoded paths
- For catalog-backed Pages UI in 0.4.x, enable both facade features `pages` and `i18n`, then use `I18nContext` with `t!` (or `tr` / `tn` / `tp` / `tnp`) instead of per-label asynchronous translation resources
- In 0.4.x, keep locale updates validated through `I18nContext::set_locale()` / `locale()`; do not depend on the removed writable `locale_signal()` accessor
- In 0.4.x, configure SSR Pages i18n through `SsrOptions::new().i18n_context(context)` so the renderer writes `pages.i18n` state and hydration restores the resolved catalogs before the first client render
- Boolean attributes require expressions, not literals (`disabled: is_disabled`, NOT `disabled: true`)
- `img` elements require both `src` and `alt` (compile-time enforcement)
- `button` elements require text content or `aria-label`/`aria-labelledby`
- URL attributes (`href`, `src`, `action`, `formaction`) block dangerous schemes (`javascript:`, `data:`, `vbscript:`)
- ALL code comments must be in English
- Use `reinhardt-query` for any SQL construction, NEVER raw SQL
- `#[server_fn]` functions should inject shared keyed services for application business logic (`Depends<K, T>`) instead of constructing settings directly and calling free functions
- Prefer DI services over utility-function clusters for business operations that own domain policy, state transitions, validation policy, orchestration dependencies, lifecycle scoping, or test overrides
- Reserve utility functions for pure codecs, DTO conversion, error mapping, provider-local wire conversion, and narrow private transformations that do not need request-scoped dependencies
- Keep Pages app `services/` modules focused on injectable keys, provider functions, and service structs/functions; put prompt builders, provider adapters, parsers, converters, repository/database internals, and narrow private helpers under app-local `server/` modules
- Since 0.2.x, reactive expressions in `page!` are auto-wrapped — explicit `Page::reactive(...)` is no longer needed
- Since 0.2.x, `use_effect`/`use_memo`/`use_callback` take explicit dependency arrays
- Use `use_action` for async mutations, `use_resource` for async reads or derived text, and `use_callback` / `use_callback_with` for event handlers; keep `spawn_local` as an escape hatch for low-level browser integration only
- In 0.3.x, use `use_resource(fetcher, deps)` for both mount-only and dependency-driven resources; replace `create_resource*`
- In 0.3.x, replace `use_effect_event*` with `use_callback*` or `.get_untracked()` inside the effect
- Route internal button-triggered redirects through `reinhardt::pages::navigate(..., NavigationType::Push)` or the current router handle API; use `window.location.set_href` only for external URLs or hard-navigation fallbacks
- In 0.4.x, use a small `#[server_fn]` plus `use_resource` only for translation-dependent copy that is truly server-only or depends on server-side policy/data; do not add that round trip for normal catalog-backed Pages labels that `t!` can render synchronously
- In 0.1.x through 0.3.x, expose app-local server-side translations through a small registered `#[server_fn]` and load them with `use_resource` plus a stable fallback instead of duplicating gettext logic behind client/server cfg gates
- Put route-backed `#[component]` wrappers under `src/apps/<app>/client/components/`, not in app-local `pages.rs` or `client/pages`
- For `#[server_fn]`, keep endpoint-specific request flows visible; do not move the same logic into `server/`, `service/`, or `services/` unless the extraction creates a narrower contract, shared dependency, or independently testable invariant
- Keep simple `Model::objects()` CRUD visible inside the `#[server_fn]` or nearby endpoint helper; avoid semantic wrappers such as `get_project_model`, `list_document_chunks`, or `document_path` when they only hide a direct ORM call
- Inline and delete single-use helpers that only delegate one `#[server_fn]` section's request, dependencies, and persistence/provider sequence
- Test service-boundary domain rules directly when a service owns lifecycle, validation, state-transition, or orchestration policy
- Use 0.3 Pages primitives directly where relevant: `#[wasm_server_api]`, `Portal` / `mount_portal`, `ActivityBoundary`, `ViewTransitionBoundary`, and `FieldArray`
- Keep shared app code cfg-clean across native and `wasm32-unknown-unknown`; rely on documented inert stubs instead of broad call-site `#[cfg]` workarounds
